# X Compile-time Errors

A compile-time error is reported if the compiler spotted the violation of one of the rules specified by the Krypton Specification. Error codes are guaranteed to be consistent; the error message may be subject to change.

For the same illegal code it is not guaranteed that the same error is reported in case that there are multiple errors.
